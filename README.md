## üåê Proxy Server Setup (CORS Fix)

Dhan's API does not support CORS for browser extensions. This project includes a simple Node.js proxy server:

- Start it with `pnpm start` (see above)
- The extension will automatically use `http://localhost:3001/positions` for API calls
- **Never share your access token**

---

## üîí Security & Privacy
- Your Dhan access token is stored only in your browser (Chrome sync storage)
- All API calls are proxied locally; your data never leaves your machine
- **Open source**: Review the code yourself!
